# 🏢 Residential Building Electrical Design Project

A complete electrical service design for a modern residential building - from lighting calculations to power distribution systems.

## 📋 What's This Project About?

We designed the entire electrical system for a multi-story residential building from scratch! This includes everything from deciding how many light bulbs go in each room to sizing transformers and backup generators. Think of it as creating the "nervous system" that brings electricity safely to every corner of a building.

**Built with:** AutoCAD 2007  
**Course:** Electrical Service Design (EEE 4418)  
**Institution:** Islamic University of Technology  
**Completed:** September 2025

## 🏠 The Building We Designed

### Each Apartment Has:
- 3 bedrooms (perfect for families!)
- 1 kitchen with proper lighting for cooking
- 3 bathrooms with exhaust fans
- 3 balconies (verandas)
- 1 living room
- 1 dining area

### Ground Floor Includes:
- Parking for multiple vehicles
- Generator room (for backup power)
- Service rooms
- Common restrooms

### Rooftop Features:
- Open space
- Utility room
- Water storage tanks

## 🔌 What We Designed

### Visual Plans
We created detailed floor plans showing:
- Where every light switch goes
- Where to place power outlets
- How wires run through walls (conduits)
- Complete layouts for ground floor, residential floors, and rooftop

### Electrical System Diagrams
We drew up the complete wiring system:
- How each room connects to its switchboard
- How switchboards connect to distribution boards
- Emergency lighting circuits (for when main power fails)
- The main power distribution system for the entire building

## 💡 How We Calculated Everything

### Lighting Design (Made Simple!)
We didn't just guess how many lights each room needs. We calculated it scientifically:

**For example, a bedroom:**
- Room size: about 13.24 m²
- Required brightness: 100 lux (industry standard)
- Solution: 1 ceiling fan + 1 tube light + 1 bulb
- Result: 108.3 lux ✓ (meets the requirement!)

**Kitchen needs more light:**
- Brightness target: 200 lux (you need to see what you're cooking!)
- Solution: 1 tube light + 1 bulb + 1 exhaust fan

### Power Requirements

Here's what the building needs to run:

| Area | Power Needed | What It Runs |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| One apartment | 13,700 W | Lights, fans, ACs, appliances |
| Entire floor (4 units) | 54,800 W | All apartments on one level |
| Ground floor | 1,300 W | Common areas, parking lights |
| **Whole building** | **185,700 W** | Everything including lift & pumps |

### The Big Equipment

**Transformer (Power Station):**
- Size: 315 kVA
- Job: Steps down high voltage from the grid to safe levels for homes
- Can be reduced to 250 kVA if we improve power factor

**Backup Generator:**
- Size: 100 kVA
- Fuel: Diesel
- Runtime: 12-14 hours on one tank
- Features: Automatic start when power fails, weatherproof, quiet operation

## 🔧 Technical Specs (For The Curious)

### Wiring Standards
We used different wire sizes based on how much power flows through them:
- **Light duty** (lights, fans): 1.5 mm² wires
- **Medium duty** (outlets, small appliances): 2.5 mm² wires  
- **Heavy duty** (air conditioners): 6 mm² wires
- **Main feeders** (floor-to-floor): 70 mm² wires

All wiring includes proper earth (ground) wires for safety!

### Power Ratings We Used
- Ceiling fan: 100W
- LED bulb: 20W
- Tube light: 20W
- Wall socket (max): 100W
- Air conditioner: 2,500W

## 🛡️ Safety First!

### Emergency Backup System
We designed a separate emergency circuit that kicks in during power failures:
- Emergency lights in bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, and living areas
- Automatic transfer switch (switches to generator seamlessly)
- Dedicated emergency distribution boards

### Protection Devices
- Circuit breakers at every level to prevent overloads
- Proper grounding throughout the building
- Soft starters for motors (lifts and pumps) to prevent power surges

## 🌟 Cool Features of Our Design

✅ **Smart power distribution** - Power reaches every outlet efficiently  
✅ **Dual power supply** - Never worry about blackouts with automatic generator backup  
✅ **Optimized lighting** - Every room has just the right amount of light  
✅ **Future-proof** - System can handle additional load if needed  
✅ **Safety compliant** - Meets all electrical safety standards  

## 💭 Our Recommendations

If you're actually building this:

1. **Add power factor correction** - Can reduce transformer size and save on electricity bills
2. **Use VFDs for motors** - Makes lift and water pumps start smoothly
3. **Get a quiet generator** - Nobody wants to hear a loud motor running
4. **Regular maintenance** - Check all equipment every 6 months
5. **Consider solar panels** - Can be added to the rooftop design

## 🎓 About This Project

This is our capstone project for the Electrical Service Design course. We learned how professional electrical engineers design real building systems, and we're pretty proud of how it turned out!


**Made with ⚡ and lots of calculations by Group 04**

*P.S. - If you're wondering, yes, we did calculate the power requirements for 185,700 watts by hand. That's a lot of math!*
